# PetShop
Pet Shop Project
This Project is for my PHP and MySQL course while I was a student at Guilford Technical Community College.
Focus for this assignment was placed on creating a simple e-commerse site for a fictious pet shop company which would allow it's customers to set up an account, log into their account and make changes to their account.
All user information was stored and managed using MySQL.
